```
meta is a tool for managing multi-project systems and libraries. It answers the conundrum of choosing between a mono repo or many repos by saying "both", with a meta repo!

meta is powered by plugins that wrap common commands, letting you execute them against some or all of the repos in your solution at once
```

# usage

```bash
npx meta git clone https://github.com/av8ta/ssb-meta-repo-all.git
```

meta will clone all of the repos contained in the [.meta](./.meta) file here in the root directory.
